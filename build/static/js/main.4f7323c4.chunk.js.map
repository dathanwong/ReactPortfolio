I wanted to get a better sense of how the tool is working under the hood so it seemed like a great project to work on for our MERN stack coding bootcamp project. It uses a lot of complex principles like sockets for real time udpating and different database relationships so it was a great learning opportunity.\" \r\n                    challenges=\"One of the biggest challenges was getting all of the pieces to work together and update seamlessly. We used React for the frontend and ended up creating lots of different components for each so making sure to update the states in all the right places got messy. Another big challenge was using MongoDB and Mongoose since it is a NoSQL database. Tasks, projects, and users are all very connected and a NoSQL db isn't really meant for objects with lots of relationships so making our db work was more difficult than if we used a SQL db.\" \r\n                    nextSteps=\"If I was to take this project further I would definitely refactor the code to use something like Redux to more easily manage global states across the application. Also, refactor the backend to use a SQL database to make the relationships easier to manage. There are also small bugs here and there that I would like to clean up that we weren't able to get to in a week's time.\" \r\n                    collaborators={<p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/aricjeon/\">Aric Jeon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/bradymoir/\">Brady Moir</a></p>} \r\n                    links={<a href=\"https://github.com/JiraClone/JiraClone\">GitHub Repo</a>} />\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div className=\"col-sm-10 col-md-10 col-lg-6 col-xl-5\">\r\n                <ProjectCard id=\"2\" title=\"Sorting Algo Visualizer\" imageLink={SortingAlgos} \r\n                    description=\"Visualizer for common sorting algorithms\" \r\n                    technologies=\"Java, JavaScript, SpringBoot, D3js, jQuery, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap\" \r\n                    inspiration=\"Going through the Coding Dojo bootcamp I had the pleasure of working with people from a lot of different backgrounds. Not everybody had a computer science or engineering background so some struggled more than others to understand how sorting algorithms worked. This gave me the idea to create a visualization tool that would help people see exactly what is happening for each sorting algorithm at each step of the code. Our visualizer uses colors heavily so of course we added a color blind mode that changes the color palette to be more color blind friendly.
